# Exercise 1
# Write code to switch the order of the winners list so that it is now A to Z by last name. Assign this list to the variable z_winners.


winners = ['Alice Munro', 'Alvin E. Roth', 'Kazuo Ishiguro', 'Malala Yousafzai', 'Rainer Weiss', 'Youyou Tu']

z_winners = sorted(winners, key = lambda x: x.split()[-1])



# Exercise 2
# Given the same dictionary, medals, now sort by the medal count. Save the three countries with the highest medal count to the list, top_three.


medals = {'Japan':41, 'Russia':56, 'South Korea':21, 'United States':121, 'Germany':42, 'China':70}

# Exercise 3
# Create a function called last_four that takes in an ID number and returns the last four digits. For example, the number 17573005 should return 3005.
# Then, use this function to sort the list of ids stored in the variable, ids, from lowest to highest. Save this sorted list in the variable, sorted_ids. 
# Hint: Remember that only strings can be indexed, so conversions may be needed.

sorted_ids = sorted(ids, key = last_four)



# Exercise 4
# Sort the list ids by the last four digits of each id. Do this using lambda and not using a defined function. Save this sorted list in the variable sorted_id.


ids = [17573005, 17572342, 17579000, 17570002, 17572345, 17579329]

# Exercise 5
# Sort the following list by each elementâ€™s second letter a to z. Do so by using lambda. Assign the resulting value to the variable lambda_sort.
