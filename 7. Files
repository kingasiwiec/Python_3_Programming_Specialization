# Exercise 1
# The following sample file called studentdata.txt contains one line for each student in an imaginary class. The students name is the first thing on each line, 
# followed by some exam scores. The number of scores might be different for each student.
# Using the text file studentdata.txt write a program that prints out the names of students that have more than six quiz scores.


file = open("studentdata.txt", "r")

for line in file:
    item = line.split()
    if len(item) >= 6:
        print(item[0])
file.close()



# Exercise 2
# Create a list called destination using the data stored in travel_plans.txt. Each element of the list should contain a line from the file that lists a country 
# and cities inside that country. Hint: each line that has this information also has a colon : in it.


file = open("travel_plans.txt", "r")
filename = file.readlines()
destination = []

for line in filename:
    if ":" in line:
        destination.append(line)
file.close()



# Exercise 3
# Create a list called j_emotions that contains every word in emotion_words.txt that begins with the letter “j”.


file = open("emotion_words.txt", "r")
filename = file.read().split()
j_emotions = []

for word in filename:
    if word[0] == 'j':
        j_emotions.append(word)

file.close()



# Exercise 4
# We have provided a file called emotion_words.txt that contains lines of words that describe emotions. Find the total number of words in the file 
# and assign this value to the variable num_words.


filename = open("emotion_words.txt", "r")
file = filename.read().split()

num_words = len(file)
print(num_words)

filename.close()



# Exercise 5
# Assign the first 30 characters of school_prompt.txt as a string to the variable beginning_chars.


filename = open("school_prompt.txt", "r")
file = filename.read()

beginning_chars = ""

for char in file[:30]:
    beginning_chars = beginning_chars + char
print(beginning_chars)

filename.close()



# Exercise 6
# Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, assign the third word of every line to a list called three.


filename = open("school_prompt.txt", "r")
file = filename.readlines()

three = []

for line in file:
    line = line.split()
    three.append(line[2])
print(three)

filename.close()



# Exercise 7
# Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, if the character ‘p’ is in a word, then add the word to a list called p_words.


filename = open("school_prompt.txt", "r")
file = filename.read().split()

p_words = []
for word in file:
    if 'p' in word:
        p_words.append(word)

print(p_words)
