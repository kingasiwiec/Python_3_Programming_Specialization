# Exercise 1
# Write a function that mirrors its string argument, generating a string containing the original string and the string backwards.

# Exercise 2
# Write a function that removes all occurrences of a given letter from a string.

# Exercise 3
# Write a Python function that will take a the list of 100 random integers between 0 and 1000 and return the maximum value. (Note: there is a builtin function named max but pretend you cannot use it.)

# Exercise 4
# Write a function sum_of_squares(xs) that computes the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list xs. For example, sum_of_squares([2, 3, 4]) should return 4+9+16 which is 29:

# Exercise 5
# Write a function to count how many odd numbers are in a list.

# Sum up all the negative numbers in a list.

        if number < 0:
            mysum = mysum + number

# Exercise 8
# You will need to write two functions for this problem. The first function, divide that takes in any number and returns that same number divided by 2. The second function called sum should take any number, divide it by 2, and add 6. It should return this new number. You should call the divide function within the sum function. Do not worry about decimals.
